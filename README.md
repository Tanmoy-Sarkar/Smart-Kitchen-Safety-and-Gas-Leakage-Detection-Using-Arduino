# Smart-Kitchen-Safety-and-Gas-Leakage-Detection-Using-Arduino

It is arduino based project where i have used a MQ Sensor as a input for detecting LPG level. There is a also lcd,servo motor and 
a dc motor fan is present. When the LPG level exceeds the set level then it shows somw warning signs in the lcd and the servo motor changes 
positon to close the door. At the same time the DC motor starts rotating to exhale all the gas out.

Again when the gas level gets to normal servo motor changes position and door opens again,DC motor stops rotating and LCD shows the
present Gas Level.
